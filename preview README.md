Welcome to **Digitalfest-events**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you

## Instructions

Project Name: Event Finder Website
Problem Statement:
People often have difficulty finding events that align with their interests. The lack of a centralized platform that aggregates events from various sources makes it challenging for users to discover events that match their preferences in terms of location, date, and type.

The platform also includes filtering options to categorize events, such as sporting events, concerts, and more. Additionally, users can rate events, contributing to the overall community experience and helping others make informed decisions.
